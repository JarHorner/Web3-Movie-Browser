## Note

There is a loading animation when fetching, make sure to clear your local storage, in order to see the fetch
The sorting is bi-directional. For example clicking year will intitially sort from lowest to greatest but clicking it again will reverse the sort, as with all other sort options. THIS IS INTENDED BEHAVIOUR NOT A BUG. Wanted to try something different with the formating. Thanks

## Another Note

Included in the code is a way to connect to a our built API to get movies instead of using a JSON file, and using that API to filter the movies instead of using Javascript functions.
